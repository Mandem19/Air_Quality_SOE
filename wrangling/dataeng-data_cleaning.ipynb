to discuss the fico_range_low, `fico_range_high`, `last_fico_range_low`, and `last_fico_range_high` columns.\n","\n","FICO scores are a credit score: a number used by banks and credit cards to represent how credit-worthy a person is. While there are a few types of credit scores used in the United States, the FICO score is the best known and most widely used.\n","\n","When a borrower applies for a loan, LendingClub gets the borrower’s credit score from FICO — they are given a lower and upper limit of the range that the borrowers score belongs to, and they store those values as `fico_range_low`, `fico_range_high`. After that, any updates to the borrowers score are recorded as `last_fico_range_low`, and `last_fico_range_high`.\n","\n","A key part of any data science project is to do everything you can to understand the data. While researching this particular data set, I found a project from 2014 by a group of students from Stanford University. In the report for the project, the group listed the current credit score (last_fico_range) among late fees and recovery fees as fields they mistakenly added to the features, but state that they later learned these columns all leak information from the future.\n","\n","However, following this group’s project, another group from Stanford worked on this same Lending Club dataset. They used the FICO score columns, dropping only `last_fico_range_low`, in their modeling. This second group’s report described `last_fico_range_high` as the one of the more important features in predicting accurate results.\n","\n","With this information, the question we must answer is: do the FICO credit scores leak information from the future? Recall a column is considered to leak information when the data it contains won’t be available when we use our model to make predictions — in this case when we use our model on future loan applications to predict whether a borrower will default.\n","\n","We examine in-depth the FICO scores for LendingClub loans, and notes that while looking at the trend of the FICO scores is a great predictor of whether a loan will default, FICO scores continue to be updated by LendingClub after a loan is funded. In other words, while we can use the initial FICO scores (`fico_range_low` and `fico_range_high`) — those would be available as part of a borrower’s applicaton — we cannot use `last_fico_range_low`, and `last_fico_range_high`, as LendingClub may have updated these after the borrower’s application.\n","\n","Lets take a look at the values in the two columns we can use:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Sr4c4B1uM4BI","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":156},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1599571584786,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":2703,"user":{"displayName":"Hassan
